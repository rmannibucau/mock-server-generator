= HAR Mock Generator

[abstract]
This extension aims at making frontend developers and backend developers communicating more accurately and in an up-to-date fashion on the contract they are linked by.

== JAX-RS (client) setup

This JAX-RS extension enables to add a feature to a client capturing requests/responses in a HAR format:

[source,java]
----
// init
final HarClientFeature feature = new HarClientFeature();
final Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
client.register(feature);

//
// do run tests, any code using the client
//

// get the har as string
final String har = new HarWriter().toString(feature.getHar())

// or directly dump the har:
new HarWriter()
  .write(Paths.get("src/dev/http-mock/generated.har"), feature.getHar());
----

TIP: this code can easily be integrated in mainstream frameworks like Arquillian, JUnit 5 etc..., don't hesitate to encapsulate it.

== Node JS integration

Then you can use any server supporting HAR to serve the saved frames.
For instance for a Node one you can use `har-express`:

[source,bash]
----
npm -i -g har-express
----

[source,javascript]
----
har-express -p 8000 ./src/dev/http-mock/generated.har
----

Or even integrate it into link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/har-express[webpack] directly.
